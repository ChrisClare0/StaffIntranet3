7363	Thomas	Allen	0609dc81-e9f6-4d48-a480-6e0d8910353e	7ee73e60-e61d-42ea-9f58-5d5ea48d88c2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	"Thomas has impressed me this year, however I feel he is not yet excelling as a mathematician. This year Thomas has made adequate progress in maths and now has a strong understanding and can confidently apply the fundamentals which underpin the more challenging aspects of mathematics. Thomas’ strong mathematical groundings will stand him in good stead for his future studies. Thomas however will often lack enthusiasm and not motivate himself fully in class, and although he is not apathetic he is yet to really immerse himself in his mathematics studies. I am very happy with Thomas’ progress this year and if he was to find an increased level of motivation he will go on to have a very successful maths career at Challoner’s."
7373	Jaymin	Bhatt	0609dc81-e9f6-4d48-a480-6e0d8910353e	7ee73e60-e61d-42ea-9f58-5d5ea48d88c2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	"Jaymin has made fantastic progress in mathematics this year, while he fully deserves his grade based on the effort and energy that he has put into his mathematical studies. Jaymin always approaches his learning with focus and enthusiasm which, when combined with his obvious enjoyment has resulted in Jaymin being a pleasure to teach. Jaymin however is often very shy in lessons and does not contribute as fully as he could do which will enable him to access the more “Challenge” style questions. Overall Jaymin is developing into a fantastic mathematician who could go on to have a very good mathematical career at Challoner’s."
7381	Navtej	Buttar	0609dc81-e9f6-4d48-a480-6e0d8910353e	7ee73e60-e61d-42ea-9f58-5d5ea48d88c2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	"Navtej has impressed me in mathematics this year as he always approaches his studies with diligence and an attention to detail that is unrivalled amongst his peers. He has made fantastic progress with his mathematics studies and this has propelled to become one of the standout mathematicians in the class.

7383	Finlay	Campbell	0609dc81-e9f6-4d48-a480-6e0d8910353e	7ee73e60-e61d-42ea-9f58-5d5ea48d88c2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	"Finlay has made fantastic progress in mathematics which has propelled him into the top ten mathematicians in the year (based on his end of year test), this is even more outstanding given his previous test performances. Finlay should be incredibly proud of his progress this year, especially as he has worked so hard in class to achieve this. Finlay should ensure that he maintains his positive attitude next year, while my only (very slight) issue with Finlay is that he is often very quiet in class and will benefit greatly from speaking up more, and approaching his studies with a bit more confidence. Overall I am very impressed with Finlay."
7384	James	Carruthers	0609dc81-e9f6-4d48-a480-6e0d8910353e	7ee73e60-e61d-42ea-9f58-5d5ea48d88c2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	James has settled into his mathematics studies in Challoner’s with ease. He has consistently performed well throughout the year and although James is yet to reach the heights that he is capable of he has continually impressed me with his understanding. I believe that if James is able to put in a little more energy and effort in class he will be able to develop into a fantastic young mathematician. I have really enjoyed teaching James this year and I hope that he is able to maintain this fantastic progress next year.
7389	Aidan	Collins	0609dc81-e9f6-4d48-a480-6e0d8910353e	7ee73e60-e61d-42ea-9f58-5d5ea48d88c2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	"I have thoroughly enjoyed teaching Aidan in mathematics this year. He is a pleasure to teach and always approaches his studies in a mature and positive fashion. Aidan has a lot of ability in mathematics although I believe that he has not lived up to his full potential in the recent end of year test, this is partly due to him lacking a calculator for the calculator paper. Aidan should learn from this and ensure that his organisation is improved in his future studies. Aidan is a very strong mathematician and if he is able to continue his current development he could go on to become a top mathematician."
7390	Rory	Collins	0609dc81-e9f6-4d48-a480-6e0d8910353e	7ee73e60-e61d-42ea-9f58-5d5ea48d88c2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	Rory is one of the most enthusiastic students that I have ever had the pleasure of teaching. This enthusiasm combined with his natural mathematical ability has meant that Rory has developed into a fantastic young mathematician. I am incredibly impressed with Rory’s ability to tackle complex problems. Rory completes work very quickly although this is mostly positive this speed often leads to him making silly mistakes. Rory always wants to get to the end of the problem without necessarily taking all of the steps and should learn that there is pleasure in the journey not solely in the answer. Rory has settled into his mathematics studies at challoners with ease and I hope he is able to maintain this into his future studies.
7391	Alexander	Coyne	0609dc81-e9f6-4d48-a480-6e0d8910353e	7ee73e60-e61d-42ea-9f58-5d5ea48d88c2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	"Alexander has made significant progress in mathematics this year, especially in his number work. Alexander has developed into a fantastic young mathematician who now has the confidence to approach complex mathematical problems. Alexander has also grown in confidence in class this year as he has settled into class and will now contribute far more than previously. Alexander must now ensure that he approaches his studies next year with this new found confidence as he has the potential to develop into a fantastic young mathematician."
7398	Gerald	Daymond	0609dc81-e9f6-4d48-a480-6e0d8910353e	7ee73e60-e61d-42ea-9f58-5d5ea48d88c2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	Gerald has made good progress in maths this year; he has also grown in confidence especially with how he now approaches his studies. Gerald has approached his studies this year in a very positive fashion and has never given up despite when he has found in challenging. This attitude and approach to his studies has really impressed me and this will be vital going forward in his mathematical career. Gerald however must learn that practice is the bedrock that mathematical ability is built upon. With the right approach next year Gerald can go on to become a top mathematician.
7415	William	Gould	0609dc81-e9f6-4d48-a480-6e0d8910353e	7ee73e60-e61d-42ea-9f58-5d5ea48d88c2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	"William is a good mathematician who is often let down by the speed that he approaches his studies. On multiple occasions this year William has been able to do complex number work in his head and evaluate sums faster than I have. This is an outstanding talent, however William has not developed as much as he could have because in class he is unable to put in the necessary practice that will underpin his brilliant, but raw mathematical ability. I hope that he is able to build on this year, and should ensure that works on his speed as he continues his studies next year."
7426	Padraig	Hill	0609dc81-e9f6-4d48-a480-6e0d8910353e	7ee73e60-e61d-42ea-9f58-5d5ea48d88c2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	"Padraig has a strong mathematical foundation and has made fantastic progress in mathematics this year, especially in his number work. Padraig, however will occasionally be off task in class and will be distracted when he should be putting in the practice that will enable him to develop his understanding further. Padraig has settled into his studies well this year and I am incredibly impressed with his ability and effort that he puts in. His end of year test was fantastic, and I am incredibly proud. Well done Padraig."
7429	William	Howells	0609dc81-e9f6-4d48-a480-6e0d8910353e	7ee73e60-e61d-42ea-9f58-5d5ea48d88c2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	William has settled into his mathematical studies at Challoner’s with ease and has truly excelled this year. The way that he approaches his studies is fantastic and his raw natural ability has enabled him to make fantastic progress this year.

Scott started the year as one of the top mathematics students in class, and I feel that because of this he went through a phase where he didn’t put in enough effort leading him to slip behind other slightly. However upon realising this Scott bounced back with an increase in effort and energy. This is such an important lesson to learn and I feel that Scott is now perfectly placed to go into next year and build on his fantastic achievement next year."
7458	Rowan	McGirr	0609dc81-e9f6-4d48-a480-6e0d8910353e	7ee73e60-e61d-42ea-9f58-5d5ea48d88c2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	2		"Rowan has been a Joy in class, he always approaches his learning with a smile on his face, and the energy that he brings to class is fantastic. Rowan has found mathematics difficult at times this year however he has shown fantastic resilience this year and has never given up. Rowan is not the most naturally gifted mathematician however has been able to achieve a good grade through guile and effort. I am incredibly proud of Rowan and wish him all the best in his future mathematics studies."
7459	Sebastian	McGrath	0609dc81-e9f6-4d48-a480-6e0d8910353e	7ee73e60-e61d-42ea-9f58-5d5ea48d88c2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	2		"Sebastian has a good foundation in mathematics, however I feel that he is yet to fully excel in maths. Sebastian has a lot of mathematical ability, but often lacks the necessary commitment to his learning to reach his potential. Sebastian is a very gifted mathematician however is not always willing to put in the necessary practice which is required to underpin his learning. Despite this I am incredibly impressed with how much progress he has made this year. Sebastian has a very bright future in mathematics."

Aidan’s one Achilles’ heel in mathematics is the sheer speed that he works at. This means that he will often make silly mistakes, or is unwilling to show his workings. Aidan must learn that there is joy and pleasure to be found in the journey and not only the answer. Aidan’s ability and enthusiasm has propelled him into the top 10 in the year and he is there on merit. Well done."
7463	Zinedine	Messaoudi	0609dc81-e9f6-4d48-a480-6e0d8910353e	7ee73e60-e61d-42ea-9f58-5d5ea48d88c2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	2		"Zinedine has had a good year in mathematics, however I am slightly disappointed as I feel that his rate of progress has slowed as the year has gone on. Zinedine has a lot of potential in mathematics, however is occasionally let down by his attitude in class, where he is not willing to put in the necessary effort to truly master a subject. Despite this Zinedine has done well and an ‘A’ is a fair result for the level that he is currently working at. With the right effort he could go on to achieve a much higher grade in the future."
7472	Dhilan	Nathwani	0609dc81-e9f6-4d48-a480-6e0d8910353e	7ee73e60-e61d-42ea-9f58-5d5ea48d88c2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	2		"Dhilan is a lovely young man, who has made fantastic progress in mathematics this year.

He started the year lacking in confidence and slightly cut adrift of the class but through his own hard work and effort has grown into a competent and reflective mathematician. By his own admission he is not the strongest mathematician, but the way that he has worked has betrayed his youth and is a skill and commitment that I wish all my students would show. I am incredibly proud of Jeremiah, and I hope he maintain this positive attitude next year."
7496	Archit	Rakhade	0609dc81-e9f6-4d48-a480-6e0d8910353e	7ee73e60-e61d-42ea-9f58-5d5ea48d88c2	9dde1233-e613-40e7-92d5-482a8da4cfc4	2		Archit is a strong mathematician who often lets himself down in exams as he rushes and makes silly mistakes. Archit should learn from this and make sure that he approaches his future exams in a more considered way. Despite this Archit is a very gifted young mathematician and if he was willing to put in the necessary effort to practice areas of mathematics that he is struggling with. Archit is a pleasure to teach and I hope that he is able to continue to progress through his mathematics career at Challoner’s.
